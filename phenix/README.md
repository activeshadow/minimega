# phenix

Welcome to `phenix`!

## Building

To build locally, you will need Golang v1.14 and Node v14.2 installed. Once
installed (if not already), simply run `make bin/phenix`.

If you don't want to install Golang and/or Node locally, you can also use
Docker to build phenix (assuming you have Docker installed). Simply run
`./build-with-docker.sh` and once built, the phenix binary will be available
at `bin/phenix`. See `./build-with-docker.sh -h` for usage details.

## Using

Please see the documentation at https://activeshadow.github.io/minimega for
phenix usage documentation.
